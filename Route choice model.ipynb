    "Road transport has been the main choice for inland freight transport within the European Union accounting for 76.30% of the modal share in 2019. Especially in the Netherlands where the port of Rotterdam generates most of the freight activity, the share of road freight is estimated at over 50% in 2019 *(1)*. This reliance on road transport calls for robust and reliable traffic operations. On the one hand, freight transport contributes to congestion and on the other hand, trucking companies in the Netherlands have suffered economic damage due to road congestion. This economic damage is estimated to be 1.5 billion euros for 2019 and this cost has been increasing yearly *(2)*. Therefore, a thorough investigation of on-trip route choices of truck drivers is fundamental to our understanding of how road freight moves which in turn can support the development of advanced traffic and logistics interventions. \n",

    "To analyze the route choice behavior of truck drivers, we consider a diversion node where truck drivers are prompted to make a choice. The study area is located near the port of Rotterdam and it also witnesses high truck percentages. The study area comprises the motorway ring (A20, A15, A16, and A4) surrounding Rotterdam in the Netherlands as shown in the following figure. \n",

    "We consider the traffic going from the hinterland (node A) to the port of Rotterdam (node B). Two route choices, marked by path 1 and 2, are considered. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes four attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ITT:** Loop detector data, provided by Regiolab-Delft service, is used to compute instantaneous travel times. MATLAB version R2018a is used to call Regiolab-Delft service. Loop detectors are installed at every 500 m of motorways in the Netherlands. It is assumed that the traffic conditions do not change for every section between the detector locations. Aggregated speed values for every detector location are retrieved every minute. Then for every such section, the instantaneous travel times are calculated from the speed data. For every path, the travel times of individual sections are added. \n",
    "2. **TTR:** Travel time reliability of a path. It is computed from historical travel time data of up to previous 10 days. It is computed using a skewness based indicator. This indicator captures the skewness of the day-to-day travel time variabilities. In contrast to other measures of unreliability which are sensitive to extreme events or outliers, it can be interpreted as the likeliness of incurring a very bad travel time (relative to the median). Mathematically, it is defined as the ratio of the difference between the $90^{th}$ and $50^{th}$ percentile and the difference between the $50^{th}$ and $10^{th}$ percentile.\n",
    "3. **LC:** The lane closures are retrieved from VMS data provided by the Regiolab-Delft service. The lane closures denote a reduction in capacity which could be a proxy for the incidents. This variable is added to test if truck drivers change their routes in response to an incident downstream. At the instant truck drivers reaches the decision node, we select a maximum number of lanes closed along a path in our analysis.\n",
    "4. **TD:** Travel distance of a path.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contain the values of these four attributes individually for both the paths 1 and 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the dataset contains the IDs of truck drivers and the availabilty of paths (PATH_AV) to check how many paths were available to truck drivers at the time of their decision making.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we load the dataset."

    "We use a multinomial logit models to estimate route choice characteristics of truck drivers. For route choice modeling, a multinomial logit (MNL) model (used as binary logit in this paper) is used. The MNL model is a discrete choice model based on random utility theory which assumes that the individual is perfectly rational and selects the alternative with the highest utility. However, the analyst is assumed to have incomplete information; therefore, uncertainty has to be taken into account. Therefore, the utility is modeled as a random variable so as to reflect the uncertainty. The utility $U_{in}$ that an individual $n$ receives from choosing alternative $i$ from the choice set $C_{n}$ is described by the following equation.\n",

    "We present an on-trip route choice model for truck drivers. The case study for truck-dominated motorways between the port of Rotterdam and hinterland in the Netherlands shows that truck drivers value significantly travel time, travel distance and lane closures en-route. Three out of five truck drivers choose the shortest time path, and this proportion increases if they could distinguish easily the time difference between the alternatives. This analysis is useful for truck-dominated motorways where a large share of traffic consists of trucks. Our analysis suggests that the routing efficiency can be improved by utilizing traffic management solutions. We can guide truck drivers effectively at the decision node. Moreover, dynamic road pricing schemes can be utilized to alter the route choices of truck drivers. "
