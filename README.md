# My-Data-Science-Portfolio
Welcome to my data science portfolio! Here, I host interesting projects created by me as a part of my research and enthusiasm to discover and learn more.

# Content
## Exploratory data analysis
* Lane-changing 
* Terminal data

## Machine Learning
* Unsupervised learning (clustering): Identified vehicle types (cars and trucks) from vehicle time stamp data as they pass through two successive Bluetooth stations.
* Unsupervised learning (probabilistic clustering): 
* Supervised learning (classification): peak hour departure
* Supervised learning (classification): Lane-changing
* Supervised learning (regression): 

## Deep learning
* Supervised learning (classification):


## Econometric models
* Choice model: A multinomial logit and mixed logit model are developed to investigate route choices of truck drivers at a diversion node.
